# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify histopathologic images as either cancerous or non-cancerous.

## ML Models
- Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  
A CNN is designed for processing images, automatically learning spatial features like shapes, edges, and textures.

## Files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook
- `images/`: Model result plots
- `data/`: Training set and test set
